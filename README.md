<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This data analysis project delves into a dataset of customer reviews for British Airways, focusing on extracting meaningful insights into the airline's service quality and customer satisfaction. The dataset includes detailed reviews covering seat comfort, food and beverage quality, cabin staff service, ground service, and in-flight entertainment.

The project employs Tableau to create engaging visualizations that highlight key areas of strength and opportunities for improvement. 

Through rigorous analysis, it identifies trends and correlations that affect passenger satisfaction, including insights into the most and least ideal countries, months, and aircraft types. This helps in understanding passenger expectations and the factors influencing their recommendations.

Key findings suggest areas where British Airways could enhance its services, such as upgrading in-flight entertainment, improving food quality, and standardizing service delivery to boost overall customer satisfaction. The visualizations provide a clear, intuitive understanding of the data, making it easy to identify trends and make data-driven recommendations.

This analysis serves as a resource for stakeholders interested in enhancing airline service quality and operational efficiency.
